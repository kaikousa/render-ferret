Installation and usage

1. install all the requirements and their requirements (can be time consuming (especially with VEE))
2. download and un-pack Render Ferret (or pull the source with Git)
3. rename settings.yml-dist to settings.yml
4. edit settings.yml
  - insert your database configuration
  - the installation folder of VEE (must point to "lib"-folder and must NOT include the forward slash)
5. create an empty database and apply the database schema from render_ferret_db.sql
6. start the daemon by typing the following to your command line
  - ruby render_ferret.rb start
